# Members: auth, profiles, cosmetics, achievements

## Auth

NextAuth v4 credentials provider with JWT sessions — no database session table
(`src/lib/auth.ts`). Sign-in at `/sign-in`; passwords are bcrypt-hashed
(`src/lib/password.ts`).

- Account status gates sign-in, and the check runs **after** password verification, so
  a probe cannot distinguish a pending account from a wrong password. Error codes:
  `ACCOUNT_PENDING`, `ACCOUNT_NOT_ACTIVE`.
- The JWT carries `role` and `username`. Tokens minted before a user had a username
  are backfilled from the DB on refresh; profile edits push updates through
  `useSession().update`.
- `src/middleware.ts` (`withAuth`) protects every app route in its matcher; `/admin/*`
  additionally requires `role === ADMIN` (non-admins redirect to `/dashboard`). It
  must live in `src/` — Next.js silently ignores a root-level middleware.ts when the
  app directory is under `src/`. Server code re-checks with `requireSession` /
  `requireAdminSession` (`src/lib/session.ts`) — middleware is the outer gate, not
  the only one.
- Signed-out visits to a gated route survive the login round-trip: the middleware
  bounce appends `callbackUrl`, the sign-in form returns there after login
  (sanitized same-origin-only via `safeCallbackUrl`, `src/lib/routes.ts`), and
  `requireSession` accepts an optional callback path for the same effect where a
  page wants it explicitly (e.g. `/join/[code]`).

## Signup and approval

Signup is open but worthless until approved: accounts start `PENDING`, and **all value
is granted at approval, not at signup** — the starting balance, Global League
membership, and the 1000-gem starting grant all land when an admin approves the account
from `/admin/members` (`src/lib/server/member-service.ts`). Pending and rejected
accounts hold nothing, so junk signups cost nothing.

- Approval is double-grant-proof: a status-guarded `updateMany` plus an
  `INITIAL_GRANT`-existence check inside one transaction; the gem grant has its own
  partial unique. Rejected accounts can be approved later, and rejected emails may
  re-register.
- Signup is globally rate-limited; members vouch for friends in the queue from
  `/invite`.
- Roles are a global `ADMIN | MEMBER` enum on `User`. Per-league authority comes from
  `LeagueMembership.role` (`docs/leagues.md`).

## Navigation

- The desktop top nav holds four shared destinations — Markets (`/dashboard`),
  Leaderboard, Leagues, Activity — and the mobile tab bar carries the same four
  (Leaderboard as "Ranks") plus Portfolio and Account. Both lists are defined
  together in `src/components/layout/nav-config.ts`, which states the mirror
  contract and the deliberate per-surface differences.
- The avatar menu holds identity plus personal destinations: Your profile,
  Portfolio, Store, Account, Admin (admins), Send feedback, Sign out. On mobile,
  Store is also reachable via the balance menu's Gems row and account-page links.
  Actions live on their pages — proposing a market is a button on `/dashboard`,
  inviting/vouching is reached from an Account-page card, and bet history is the
  second tab of `/portfolio` (`?tab=history`; the old `/history` route redirects
  there).
- Admin sub-pages (`/admin`, `/admin/markets`, `/admin/members`, `/admin/items`,
  `/admin/feedback`) share a tab-strip nav rendered by `src/app/(app)/admin/layout.tsx`.
- The notification bell sits between the balance chip and the theme toggle at every
  width; `/notifications` (most recent 50) is reached from it and is deliberately
  absent from the nav lists.

## Usernames and profiles

- `username` is the stable public handle: unique, lowercase, 3–20 chars of
  `[a-z0-9-]`, no leading/trailing hyphen, reserved words blocked
  (`src/lib/username.ts`). Display names are separate — mutable, non-unique apart from
  a case-insensitive collision check. Both are editable on `/account`, plus a bio
  (≤ 280 chars).
- Profiles live at `/u/[username]` inside the authed app — **members-only**, like
  everything else. Members bet on real-life friend events, so betting history is
  never exposed publicly.
- Profile content (`src/lib/server/profile-service.ts`): career stats computed from
  the ledger on request (net profit, markets won/played, win rate, biggest payout),
  recent resolved positions, the trophy case, and showcased achievements. Career
  stats are **Global-League-scoped** — fresh-stack league P&L would distort them;
  league performance lives on league pages and in trophy provenance. Profiles of
  non-ACTIVE users 404.

## Items and cosmetics

`Item` defines a cosmetic or trophy; `UserItem` is an owned copy with provenance
(`source`: `SEASON_TROPHY | ACHIEVEMENT | PURCHASE | ADMIN_GRANT`, plus a JSON detail
like league/season/placement).

- **Kinds:** `TROPHY` (display-only, lives in the profile trophy case) and four
  equippables mapping 1:1 to `EquipSlot`: `BADGE`, `TITLE`, `FRAME`, `BACKGROUND`
  (the profile-header banner).
- **Styles are data, not assets.** `Item.style` is a JSON blob validated per kind by
  the zod schemas in `src/lib/cosmetics.ts` — CSS/emoji parameters with hex-locked
  colors, plus a `renderer` discriminant (`css` / `emoji` / `model3d`).
  `parseItemStyle` never throws: unparseable style renders as nothing, and a
  `model3d` trophy renders a placeholder tile. There is no image upload pipeline.
- **Equipping** is one item per slot, enforced by a partial unique and performed in a
  serializable transaction (`src/lib/server/item-service.ts`). Setting an item
  `active = false` un-renders it everywhere without touching anyone's equip state.
- **Rendering convention:** pages fetch cosmetics for all visible users in **one**
  `getEquippedCosmetics(userIds[])` batch call, parsed server-side — never per row.
  Renderers live in `cosmetic-renderers.tsx` (`AvatarFrame`, `BadgeGlyph`,
  `TitleLine`, `ProfileBanner`); `MemberAvatar` wraps the generated-initials avatar
  behind a swappable `avatarNode` prop. Frames and badges render at every avatar/name
  surface; titles on the profile header and leaderboard podium; the banner on the
  profile only.
- **Grants** are idempotent via `grantKey` (e.g. trophies
  `season:{seasonId}:user:{userId}`, badges `achievement:{key}:user:{userId}`);
  admin grants carry no key and may duplicate deliberately.
- A 10-item starter catalog self-heals through upsert-by-slug on store reads
  (`ensureStarterCatalog`).

## The store

`/store` sells active items with a `storeCost` for gems. `storeCost = null` means
earned-only — some desirable items (e.g. the "The Oracle" title) stay achievement-only
so the store doesn't simply mirror the leaderboard. Purchases are one-per-user-per-item
(partial unique backstop) and run ownership check → gem balance check → grant + debit
in one serializable transaction (`src/lib/server/store-service.ts`).

Admins author items at `/admin/items`: structured per-kind style editors with live
preview and a raw-JSON escape hatch, both re-validated server-side with
`parseItemStyle` so unrenderable style can never persist. Slug and kind are immutable
after creation (a kind change would orphan equipped slots). The item detail page
includes a manual grant tool.

## Achievements

Eight achievement keys are defined in `src/lib/achievements.ts` — the definitions, gem
amounts, and badge attachments in one place:

`first-win`, `streak-3/5/10` (consecutive wins by resolution order), `longshot-win`
(a win whose pre-bet implied probability was under 10%, reconstructed from bet
snapshots), `volume-10/50/100` (settled Global markets participated in).

- **Global League only**, and only RESOLVED markets count — canceled markets advance
  nothing.
- The evaluator is pure (`evaluateAchievements`); `achievement-service.ts` builds each
  user's history in one query, diffs against already-granted keys, and grants
  idempotently (unique `[userId, achievementKey]`). `streak-5`, `streak-10`,
  `longshot-win`, and `volume-100` also grant their badge items.
- Evaluation triggers post-settlement for every staker of the resolved market (losers
  too — volume still advances) and is swept daily by the cron for the last 48 hours
  of resolutions, so a missed post-commit pass self-repairs (`docs/markets.md`).
- Members pick up to 3 achievements to showcase on their profile
  (`/u/[username]/achievements` lists all: earned lit with date and gems, unearned
  dimmed). Validation caps the showcase and requires the achievements be earned
  (`setShowcasedAchievements`).

## Feedback

Any signed-in member can send feedback from the avatar menu ("Send feedback"): a
dialog with a message (max 1000 characters) that also captures the path of the page
they were on. Submissions create append-only `Feedback` rows
(`src/lib/server/feedback-service.ts`) — there is no editing and no member-facing
history — and the submit path is rate-limited per user like comments. The captured
path is user-supplied metadata: the service drops anything that doesn't start with
`/`, and the admin view renders it as plain text, never as a link.

Admins triage at `/admin/feedback` (unresolved newest-first on top, resolved
collapsed below) and can resolve or reopen each entry — `resolvedAt` is a mutable
triage flag, not part of the append-only record. The admin dashboard's
needs-attention list shows the unresolved count with a link into the queue.

## Notifications

In-app notifications are event-driven rows in `Notification`
(`src/lib/server/notification-service.ts`), emitted **post-commit** at the service
layer — a failed emission never fails the parent operation (failures land in
`AppLog` as WARN rows). Idempotency is DB-enforced via a nullable unique
`dedupeKey` (the `UserItem.grantKey` pattern: try-create, swallow the unique
violation), so emission paths can safely re-run.

Who gets notified:

- **Proposal submitted** → whoever reviews it: app admins for Global League
  markets, the league's OWNER/MODs for custom leagues. The proposer is never
  self-notified; the same applies to every type below.
- **New member awaiting approval** → all admins, on signup (no dedupe key — a
  rejected email re-applying should re-notify the queue).
- **New feedback** → all admins.
- **Market awaiting resolution** → all admins, via a lazy sweep: no event fires
  when a market drifts past `closeTime`, so the sweep runs whenever an admin
  loads a page (`getNotificationSnapshot`), guarded by a cheap indexed count and
  deduped per market × admin.
- **Market resolved / canceled** → every staker, with their signed P&L (resolved)
  or refund (canceled) in the payload. Resolved and canceled share one
  `market-settled:` dedupe namespace per market × user — settlement is terminal,
  so a user can never receive both.
- **Proposal approved / rejected** → the proposer (shared `proposal-decision:`
  dedupe namespace — a proposal is decided exactly once).
- **Member approved** → the approved member (welcome message).

The `href` on each row is constructed server-side at emission (`marketPath` or a
fixed admin route) and is safe to render as a link. Rows are kept indefinitely.

The bell in the top nav shows the unread count and a dropdown of the most recent
notifications; `/notifications` lists the most recent 50. Clicking a notification
marks it read and navigates to its subject; "Mark all read" is available in both
surfaces. The badge refreshes on navigation (the app layout is force-dynamic) and
the mark-read actions revalidate the layout.
